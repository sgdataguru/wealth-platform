I want to share an idea for a web application designed specifically for Relationship Managers, especially those handling Ultra High Net Worth clients.

00:10.500 --> 00:20.000
The core purpose of this application is to help Relationship Managers identify early liquidity signals before they become obvious in the market.

00:20.000 --> 00:31.000
These liquidity signals can come from multiple systems and data points, such as margin-related changes, corporate actions, acquisitions, or early exit indicators.

00:31.000 --> 00:41.500
The key value here is timing. If we can detect liquidity changes early, Relationship Managers gain a strong first-mover advantage.

00:41.500 --> 00:53.000
Once these signals are identified, the system enables proactive and more personal engagement with clients.

00:53.000 --> 01:05.000
Instead of reacting late, Relationship Managers can reach out early to understand context and initiate meaningful conversations around investments or asset movement.

01:05.000 --> 01:16.000
On top of this, we introduce lead scoring based on the strength and relevance of each liquidity signal.

01:16.000 --> 01:26.000
This helps Relationship Managers prioritize the right clients, decide when to engage, and understand why an action is recommended.

01:26.000 --> 01:37.000
Liquidity events can be detected from multiple sources including private company databases, promoter information, and public domain disclosures.

01:37.000 --> 01:48.000
Examples include platforms like PrivateCircle, Zauba, and IPO-related data from exchange and market intelligence sources.

01:48.000 --> 02:00.000
The idea is to aggregate insights from multiple reliable sources rather than relying on a single dataset.

02:00.000 --> 02:13.000
Instead of storing this data in a traditional relational database, we propose using a graph database.

02:13.000 --> 02:25.000
A graph database allows us to map relationships between individuals, companies, sectors, and liquidity events.

02:25.000 --> 02:36.000
Every trigger or data change can be traced to understand its impact across companies and specific individuals.

02:36.000 --> 02:48.000
From a user experience perspective, the web application should remain simple and intuitive for Relationship Managers.

02:48.000 --> 03:00.000
The main panel can display filters such as city, sector, network, and clusters, along with top prospects and suggested actions.

03:00.000 --> 03:12.000
A right-side panel can show key metrics, alerts, and clear explanations of why each prospect is relevant.

03:12.000 --> 03:24.000
The design should follow Nuvama’s branding guidelines to ensure familiarity and ease of adoption.

03:24.000 --> 03:36.000
If feasible, we can also introduce a live AI chatbot that allows Relationship Managers to query the graph database directly.

03:36.000 --> 03:48.000
This chatbot can answer questions like which clients may experience liquidity events in the next 30 days.

03:48.000 --> 04:00.000
A small dashboard can track how many leads and liquidity events are generated and followed up by Relationship Managers.

04:00.000 --> 04:12.000
The purpose of this data is not to replace relationships but to improve timing and provide better context for engagement.

04:12.000 --> 04:24.000
Lead scoring will always be explainable, showing the reasoning and signals behind each score.

04:24.000 --> 04:36.000
The overall experience should remain simple, transparent, and actionable for Relationship Managers.

04:36.000 --> 04:48.000
At this stage, the goal is to build a demo that showcases how the system works end to end.

04:48.000 --> 05:00.000
The demo will highlight a centralized intelligence layer aggregating IPO, VC, PE, promoter, and corporate data.

05:00.000 --> 05:12.000
It will also demonstrate how graph-based insights translate into real, practical actions for Relationship Managers.

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
That is the overall idea behind this data platform. Thank you.
