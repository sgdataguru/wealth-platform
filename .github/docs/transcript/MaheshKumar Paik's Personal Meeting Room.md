## Summary

### Kairos Logo and Email Updates

The team discussed the status of an email that Ameit confirmed was acceptable and would be moved into the system next week, with expectations for tech evaluation confirmation. MaheshKumar presented the correct logo for Kairos, which was different from an earlier version due to a naming conflict with another company. The team reviewed the new Kairos logo, which features a blue background, and MaheshKumar was instructed to make changes if needed.
### Targeting Amrit Anshu for Expansion

The team discussed targeting Amrit Anshu, a private banker with 1 billion in assets under management, who manages family office money for ultra-high net worth clients in the Middle East and Africa. They explained that this client would require an on-premises solution due to their strict compliance requirements, particularly in UAE. The discussion also covered their existing platform, Finova, which they are using with DBS and Nirvana, and plan to expand into the Middle East market.
### Finova Integration Research Plan

The team discussed integrating with Finova, a recording system similar to Salesforce, for a client who does not use other platforms like Salesforce. MaheshKumar was tasked with researching Finova's APIs and integration capabilities, noting that while APIs would likely incur costs, they are standard for system interactions. The team also considered reaching out to contacts in their networks who could provide insights about Finova's implementation in the region.
### Finova Compliance Strategy Discussion

The team discussed a potential opportunity with a company called Finova, focusing on their compliance and regulatory reporting needs. They identified that Finova's target customers include family offices, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and enterprises, which is different from their typical Indian client base. The team also learned about the Saudi Vision 2030 initiative and its potential relevance to Finova's business, though they need to research more details about this. They agreed to investigate how to adapt their product offerings, which currently include equity, debt, and MPS, to meet Finova's unique customer segment and regulatory requirements.
### Dubai Market Solution Adaptation

The team discussed adapting their solution for the Dubai market, focusing on signals for liquidity events, tax optimization, and estate planning for high-net-worth individuals, sovereign wealth funds, and pension funds. They agreed to modify their signal sources to be more Middle East and global-focused, with Finova providing existing client data and RM Intelligence for prospective clients. Mahesh emphasized the importance of identifying the right people and suggested simulating the target environment to ensure relevance. The team also considered the number of users and the validity of the problem statement about liquidity signals, with Ashish planning to confirm details with the client.
### Finova Integration Strategy Discussion

The team discussed challenges with Finova, noting its difficulty in making changes and implementing new features, which could be beneficial for their integration strategy. They explored the idea of creating a layer that could act as an intermediary, allowing for faster actions and reducing churn while leveraging Finova's existing capabilities. MaheshKumar highlighted the need to understand Finova's current problem statement and its limitations, particularly regarding on-premises and cloud compatibility. The discussion also touched on currency standardization, with a decision to use dollars for consistency across regions.
### Wealth Management Platform Global Updates

The team discussed updates to a wealth management platform, focusing on creating separate versions for India and UAE markets. MaheshKumar explained that he would update the system to include Middle Eastern city names and improve network accuracy. Tasneem offered to provide Dubai-specific details. The group agreed to add features like compliance reporting, wallet share tracking, and crisis management capabilities. They decided to build the platform with a global perspective, integrating data sources from various financial systems. The team planned to have a brief follow-up call the next day to review progress.
