# User Story: 7 - Track Leads and Follow-ups on Dashboard

**As a** Relationship Manager,
**I want** to see a dashboard tracking how many leads and liquidity events have been generated and followed up,
**so that** I can measure my engagement effectiveness and ensure no opportunities are missed.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Dashboard displays count of total leads generated
* Dashboard shows count of liquidity events detected
* Tracks which leads have been followed up vs. pending
* Metrics are updated in real-time or near real-time
* Historical trends may be shown (daily/weekly/monthly)
* Dashboard is visually clear and scannable

## Notes

* This is a small dashboard component for tracking activity
* Helps RMs stay accountable and measure their proactive engagement
