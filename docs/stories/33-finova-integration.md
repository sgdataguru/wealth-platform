# User Story: 33 - Finova Integration for Client Intelligence

**As a** Relationship Manager,
**I want** the platform to integrate bi-directionally with **Finova**,
**so that** I have a single source of truth for all client data, transactions, and interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Automated daily (or near real-time) sync of client balances and holdings from Finova APIs.
* Discovery signals (liquidity, tax triggers) are enriched with existing data from Finova.
* RM touchpoints and activity logs originating in the platform are synced back to Finova records.

## Notes

* Transcription focus: "Research Finova APIs to understand integration capabilities and data sharing options."
* Replaces previous reliance on local systems for core client recording.
