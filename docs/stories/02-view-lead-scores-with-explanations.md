# User Story: 2 - View Lead Scores with Explanations

**As a** Relationship Manager,
**I want** to see lead scores for each prospect with clear explanations of why the score was assigned,
**so that** I can prioritize the right clients and understand the reasoning behind each recommendation.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Each prospect displays a lead score (numerical or categorical rating)
* Lead score includes an explanation showing the signals that contributed to it
* Explanations are clear and actionable (not black-box)
* Scores help determine when to engage and why action is recommended
* Higher scores indicate stronger/more relevant liquidity signals

## Notes

* Lead scoring is based on the strength and relevance of each liquidity signal
* The system should always provide explainable scores showing the reasoning behind each
* Purpose is to help RMs decide which clients to engage, when, and why
