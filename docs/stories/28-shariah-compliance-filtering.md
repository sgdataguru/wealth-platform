# User Story: 28 - Shariah Compliance Filtering

**As a** Relationship Manager,
**I want** to filter prospects and investment products based on Shariah compliance status,
**so that** I can provide religiously aligned advice to clients requiring Shariah-compliant (Halal) portfolios.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Client and prospect profiles include a **'Shariah Filter'** status (Compliant/Non-Compliant).
* Investment products (Equity, Sukuk, Mutual Funds, etc.) are tagged with their specific Shariah certification status.
* RM can toggle a "Shariah-Only" view on the dashboard to filter all opportunities.
* Automated alerts if a client's portfolio drift includes non-compliant holdings.

## Notes

* Terminology: Use "Shariah Filter", "Compliant", and "Halal" as per transcript.
* Crucial for the GCC market (Saudi Arabia, UAE).
