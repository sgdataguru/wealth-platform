# User Story: 4 - View Top Prospects with Suggested Actions

**As a** Relationship Manager,
**I want** to see a prioritized list of top prospects with suggested actions,
**so that** I can quickly identify which clients to engage with and what action to take.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Main panel displays top prospects ranked by lead score/relevance
* Each prospect card shows key information (name, company, signal type)
* Suggested actions are displayed for each prospect (e.g., "Schedule call", "Review portfolio")
* Clicking on a prospect reveals more details
* List is dynamically updated as new signals are detected

## Notes

* The experience should remain simple, transparent, and actionable
* Design should follow Nuvama's branding guidelines for familiarity and ease of adoption
