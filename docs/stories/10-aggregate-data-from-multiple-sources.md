# User Story: 10 - Aggregate Data from Multiple Intelligence Sources

**As a** Relationship Manager,
**I want** the system to aggregate insights from multiple reliable data sources,
**so that** I have a comprehensive view of liquidity events rather than relying on a single dataset.

## Acceptance Criteria

* System ingests data from private company databases (e.g., PrivateCircle)
* System ingests promoter information and public domain disclosures
* System ingests IPO-related data from exchanges and market intelligence
* System ingests data from platforms like Zauba
* Data sources are clearly attributed when displaying signals
* Conflicting data from different sources is handled appropriately

## Notes

* Liquidity events can be detected from multiple sources including private company databases, promoter information, and public domain disclosures
* The idea is to aggregate insights from multiple reliable sources rather than relying on a single dataset
* Demo will showcase a centralized intelligence layer aggregating IPO, VC, PE, promoter, and corporate data
