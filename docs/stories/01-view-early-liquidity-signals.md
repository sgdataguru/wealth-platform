# User Story: 1 - View Early Liquidity Signals

**As a** Relationship Manager handling UHNW clients,
**I want** to view early liquidity signals detected from multiple data sources,
**so that** I can gain a first-mover advantage and engage with clients before opportunities become obvious in the market.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Dashboard displays a list of detected liquidity signals with timestamps
* Each signal shows the source (margin changes, corporate actions, acquisitions, early exit indicators)
* Signals are sorted by recency and relevance
* Signal details include the affected client/prospect and signal type
* Signals are updated in near real-time as new data is ingested

## Notes

* Liquidity signals can come from multiple systems: margin-related changes, corporate actions, acquisitions, or early exit indicators
* The key value is timing - detecting changes early provides competitive advantage
* Data sources include PrivateCircle, Zauba, IPO-related data, exchange and market intelligence sources
