# User Story: 9 - Receive Proactive Engagement Suggestions

**As a** Relationship Manager,
**I want** to receive proactive suggestions for client engagement based on detected signals,
**so that** I can reach out early to understand context and initiate meaningful conversations around investments or asset movement.

## Acceptance Criteria

* System generates engagement suggestions when significant signals are detected
* Suggestions include the client name, signal context, and recommended action
* Suggestions appear as notifications or in a dedicated section
* Each suggestion links to the prospect detail for full context
* Suggestions are timely (delivered when signal is fresh)

## Notes

* Instead of reacting late, RMs should be able to reach out early
* Engagement should be proactive and more personal
* The goal is meaningful conversations around investments or asset movement
