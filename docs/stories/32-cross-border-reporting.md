# User Story: 32 - Cross-border Multi-structured Reporting

**As an** Executive Dashboard User,
**I want** to view consolidated wealth reports across multiple jurisdictions and complex entity structures,
**so that** I have a comprehensive global view of client exposure and firm performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Support for multi-currency normalization to **USD** with Millions/Billions formatting.
* Visual breakdown of wealth by jurisdiction and entity structure (Trusts, VCCs, Foundations).

## Notes

* Shifts context from India-only to Global/Middle East.
* Transcription requirement: "Add compliance tab with cross-border and multi-structured reporting capabilities."
