# User Story: 6 - Query Data with AI Chatbot

**As a** Relationship Manager,
**I want** to ask natural language questions to an AI chatbot about liquidity events and prospects,
**so that** I can quickly get answers without navigating through complex filters or reports.

## Acceptance Criteria

* AI chatbot is accessible from the main interface
* Chatbot understands natural language queries about clients and liquidity events
* Example query: "Which clients may experience liquidity events in the next 30 days?"
* Chatbot returns relevant, accurate responses from the graph database
* Responses include links or references to relevant prospects/signals
* Chat history is maintained within the session

## Notes

* This feature is marked as "if feasible" - may be a future enhancement
* Chatbot queries the underlying graph database directly
* Should support questions about timing, clients, events, and relationships
