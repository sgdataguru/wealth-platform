# Business Case: UHNW Liquidity Intelligence Platform

## Problem Statement

Relationship Managers (RMs) serving Ultra High Net Worth (UHNW) clients face significant challenges in identifying and acting on liquidity events in a timely manner. Critical opportunities for financial engagement—such as business exits, large asset sales, or inheritance events—are often discovered too late or missed entirely, resulting in:

- Lost business opportunities
- Reduced client satisfaction
- Competitive disadvantage as other financial institutions capitalize on these moments
- Reactive rather than proactive client relationship management

Traditional approaches rely on manual research, news monitoring, and client self-disclosure, which are inefficient and incomplete for the fast-paced UHNW segment.

Enable Relationship Managers to be the first to engage with UHNW clients during critical liquidity events, positioning the institution as proactive and informed.

### 3. **UHNW-Focused Intelligence**
Deliver specialized insights tailored to clients with 100+ Crore portfolios, recognizing the unique dynamics and opportunities in this segment.
