- **Protect exact calibration** (weights, decay constants, ML models) as trade secrets

**Result**: Competitors can see *what* we do (patents are public) but cannot replicate *how well* we do it (trade secrets).

---

### 2. Barriers to Entry

**Technical Complexity**:

- IP-01 requires 1,000+ historical RM transactions to calibrate weights
- IP-02 requires 5,000+ historical events to train ML timeline prediction model
- IP-04 requires 10,000+ wealth management conversations to fine-tune LLM

**Time to Replicate**: 18-24 months (even with our patents as a blueprint)

**Cost to Replicate**: ₹5-10 Crores ($600K-1.2M USD) in R&D

---

### 3. Revenue Protection

**Market Size**: India UHNW wealth management technology market = ₹500 Cr+ ($60M+ USD)

**Our IP Protects**:
